However, the punchline redirects the expectation by using 'stick' to mean a 'matchstick,' which is commonly used to effortlessly start a fire. The humor arises from the shift in the expected method of using two pieces of ordinary wood to the surprising and literal use of a matchstick.","The humor in this joke lies in the unexpected and absurd solution to the problem of starting a fire.

Q: What’s worse than finding a worm in your apple? A: Finding half a worm!,"The humor in this joke arises from the unexpected twist in the answer. Initially, one might think that finding a worm in an apple is quite bad, but the joke suggests that finding half a worm is worse because it implies you may have eaten the other half without realizing it.
