https://explainthejoke.com/2013/01/16/the-late-broom/,Q: Why was the broom late? A: It over swept!,"Explanation: Brooms are for sweeping; one reason that people are late is because they over sleep. “Sleep” in the past tense is “slept” (everyday I sleep, yesterday I slept). “Slept” rhymes with swept (swept is sweep in the past tense- everyday I sweep, yesterday I swept). This joke is funny because the expected answer is “It over slept” not its rhyme, “It over swept.”"
https://explainthejoke.com/2015/09/04/flying-garbage/,Q:What has 4 wheels and flies? A:A garbage truck!,"Explanation:When you hear “4 wheels and flies” you expect that the word “flies” means something that flies in the air like an airplane or perhaps Superman. You do not expect that “flies” means the insect, fly (or rather the plural of fly: flies).
It’s true: a garbage truck has 4 wheels and lots of flies because flies like garbage.
And just for fun, here is a flying garbage truck:

https://explainthejoke.com/2022/12/04/leave-hanging/,Q: What happens when winter arrives? A: Autumn leaves!,"Explanation: In the northern hemisphere winter officially starts on December 21 (winter solstice, astronomical winter), but for many places in the north, it is already cold. Did you know that there is more than one way to mark the start of winter? Meteorologists, people who study the weather, talk about meteorological winter which starts on December 1. When talking about seasons, winter comes after fall; fall is also known as autumn.
In the autumn, leaves change colors and fall to the ground as the trees get ready for the winter, and the following spring. Autumn leaves are beautiful!
Leaves, though, has another meaning. When something leaves, it goes away. For example, the teacher leaves home to go to work, and the student leaves school to go home.
This joke is funny because it plays with two meanings of the word leaves: The tree has leaves that change colors in the autumn (autumn leaves), and autumn leaves, or goes away, so that winter can come.
Eric Clapton has a song called Autumn Leaves–"
https://explainthejoke.com/2013/03/07/escalator-nope/,Q: What goes up and down but does not move? A: Stairs!,"Explanation: You walk up the stairs and down the stairs. We say “the stairs go up to the next floor” or “the stairs go down to the basement.” That is, the stairs “go” but they do not move! Ha!
"
https://explainthejoke.com/2021/04/17/trousers-again/,Q: What does a dog do that a person steps into? A: Pants!,"Explanation: Thank you to a friend from India for sending another joke about pants!
Last week I explained about pants, the ones you wear that are also called trousers or slacks.
Pant is also the way a dog breathes when it is hot, usually a quick breathing with its tongue sticking out. A dog pants. So a person steps into pants and a dog pants.
This joke is funny because it plays with two meanings of the word pants. It is also funny because when you read the joke, you might think of something a dog does (poops) that a person might step in (that’s kind of gross, but it happens.)
Here is an explanation of why dogs pant:"
https://explainthejoke.com/2016/11/02/musical-teeth/,Q:What musical instrument is found in the bathroom? A:A tuba toothpaste.,"Explanation:A ‘tuba‘ is a large musical instrument, a brass instrument, that plays very low notes when you blow into it.
A tube of toothpaste is, well, toothpaste that comes in a tube and it is usually kept in the bathroom.
If you say “tube of toothpaste” fast it sounds like “tuba toothpaste” and that is what makes this joke funny.
Here is an old commercial for Ipana Toothpaste with Bucky Beaver:

https://explainthejoke.com/2020/01/24/my-treat/,Q: What did one plate say to the other? A: Dinner is on me!,"Explanation: When a meal such as breakfast, lunch, or dinner is served, it is typically put on a plate. If you go to a restaurant, the server may bring your food on a tray; the plates are then taken from the tray and set on your table. Your food is on the plate. So, if a plate full of food is talking, dinner (or lunch or breakfast) is really on the plate.
“Dinner is on me” is also an idiom that means, “I will pay for your food.” When you go to a restaurant and someone says to you, “Dinner is on me,” it means that the speaker will buy your meal. (Be sure to say, “Thank you” if someone buys your dinner!)
This joke is funny because it plays with the idiom, “dinner is on me.” Dinner is actually on the plate… and, in this joke, the plate will pay for dinner. (By the way, the title “My treat” is another idiom that means that the speaker will pay for the meal.)

https://explainthejoke.com/2017/03/13/a-pirates-life/,Q: What is a pirate’s favorite letter? A: You might think it’d be R but ’tis the C they love!,"Explanation: Pirates are known for saying “Arrrr.” But it is really the Sea (C) they love.
Of course they love the sea (pronounced the same as C ), the ocean. It’s where they sail their ships: upon the ocean.
This joke plays with the traditional answer to this joke (R or arrgh) and adds a new idea.
Here are some singing pirates for kids…
And here is a Jimmy Buffet song about pirates for adults:
Thank you to adakkusu-san!"
https://explainthejoke.com/2013/12/21/carol-for-mom-and-dad/,Q:What is a parent’s favorite Christmas carol? A:Silent Night.,"Explanation:Christmas carols are the songs sung at Christmas time. Moms and dads enjoy a night that is quiet once in a while. Silent Night is the name of a Christmas carol and a silent night for parents means that the children are asleep. “All is calm.”
"
https://explainthejoke.com/2014/05/19/braniac/,Q:Why is spaghetti the smartest food? A:It always uses its noodle!,"Explanation:Yum! Spaghetti! To “use your noodle” is to use your brain, that is, to think. Spaghetti is a type of noodle.
This joke plays with the word noodle, both your brain and the pasta. Now I’m hungry and off to the kitchen I go!
"
https://explainthejoke.com/2021/10/24/piqued-my-interest/,Q: Why can’t you play hide and seek with mountains? A: Because they are always peaking!,"Explanation: Hide and seek is a game that children play. In this game, one or more child finds a place to hide while another child closes his or her eyes and counts to 10. When the person counting gets to 10, that person goes to look for the ones who are hiding The person who is counting has to close his or her eyes in order not to see where the people are going to hide.
If the person who is counting secretly looks to see where the others are hiding, that is called peeking. To peek means to take a small, secret look. Peeking is not allowed while playing hide and seek.
Peek (to secretly look) sounds just like peak (the top of a mountain). When you get to the top of a mountain you get to the peak. (If you like grammar, peek and peak are homophones.)
This joke is funny because it plays with the word peek/peak that sound the same but have very different meanings. Clearly, mountains cannot peek, but they have a peak.
Here is some motivation from Sister Sledge for you to reach your peak:"
https://explainthejoke.com/2013/11/23/the-coughing-coffin/,Q: Why are graveyards noisy? A: Because of all the coffin!,"Explanation: A coffin is the box that dead people are buried in. Coughing is the body’s natural response when there is a tickle in the throat and you try to clear it- you cough.
This joke is funny because it plays on the similar sound of “coffin” and “coughing.” In English, many people drop the final ‘g’ sound on words ending in ‘ing.’ That makes “coffin” and “coughing” sound even more alike.
Don’t let your coughin’ send you to the coffin! See a doctor!"
https://explainthejoke.com/2021/02/15/door-prize/,Q: Why did the scientist install a knocker on his front door? A: Because he wanted to win the no-bell prize!,"Explanation: A knocker is that metal piece on the outside of a door that you use to make noise so that people know that you are there. An alternative to using a door knocker is to use a doorbell. A doorbell is a button, typically found next to the door, that you push to make noise inside the house so that people know that you are there.
If you do not have a doorbell, you have no bell. “No bell” sounds like Nobel. Nobel is the name of a prize in many different categories including physics, chemistry, peace, and literature.
This joke is funny because no-bell sounds like Nobel, and the scientist wanted to win a no-bell/Nobel prize. (That strategy probably won’t help him win!)
Here is some information about the Nobel Prizes:"
https://explainthejoke.com/2013/04/18/elfabet/,Q: What do elves learn in school? A: The elf-abet!,"Explanation: One elf (singular), two elves (plural). Elves are mythological beings found in stories like The Hobbit or found at the north pole working for Santa Claus. The alphabet is learned by school children in all English speaking schools (and other languages too!). “Elf” sounds like “alf” or “alph,” the first part of the word alphabet. This joke is funny because it plays on the sounds in elf and alph.
Thanks “Tree” for sending the joke."
https://explainthejoke.com/2016/03/07/all-decked-out/,Q: Why couldn’t the pirate play cards? A: Because he was sitting on the deck!,"Explanation: The flat part of sail boat (or pirate ship!) where you stand is called the deck. A group of playing cards is called a deck of cards. If you are sitting on a deck of cards you can’t play with them… and that’s what the pirate was doing! Or maybe he was sitting on the deck of his ship.
This joke is funny because of the double meaning of the word ‘deck.’
If you are interested in learning how to play a new card game take a look at this video:"
https://explainthejoke.com/2014/05/21/faulty-boomerang/,Q: What do you call a boomerang that doesn’t come back? A: A stick!,"Explanation: That’s just silly! A boomerang is currently used as a toy but according to some histories it was/ is used for hunting. Originally it was made of wood but now can be made of plastic or other material.
This joke is funny because you expect a more serious answer and not such a silly answer. Of course if you throw a stick it will not come back."
https://explainthejoke.com/2016/02/25/dread-knight/,Q:What bug do knights hate? A:Dragonflies!,"Explanation:Bugs are insects. A knight (sounds like night) is a soldier for a king or queen. They often wore armor or a coat of mail and rode on horses. In stories, knights sometimes fight dragons.
A dragonfly is an insect that eats mosquitoes. They are beautiful and they do not bite people!
Knights hate dragons but notdragonflies– and that is why this joke is funny!
Here is a video all about dragonflies:

https://explainthejoke.com/2021/06/20/made-in-the-shade/,Q: Why didn’t the girl trust the trees near her home? A: They seemed a little shady!,"Explanation: Shade is the darker, cooler area under a tree when the sun is shining on the tree. If you want to get out of the sun, you might stand under a tree in the shade. You might stand in the shady area.
Shady also means something that doesn’t seem quite right, not honest, not trustworthy maybe illegal. If someone tries to sell you an expensive watch for very little money you might say, “No, that seems a little shady.”
This joke is funny because it plays with the word shady, like under a tree in the sun or a dishonest situation or person.
By the way, Happy Father’s Day to all the fathers out there, and to all people who are like a father to someone.
Here is a shady character from one of my favorite books, Ray Bradbury’s Something Wicked This Way Comes ( it’s a bit scary):"
https://explainthejoke.com/2013/12/09/going-up-or-down/,Q: What did one elevator say to the other elevator? A: I think I’m coming down with something!,Explanation: There is a double meaning in this joke: “To come down with something” is to get sick; elevators come down with something- people. When the first elevator says it is coming down with something the listener hears the double meaning of getting sick and going to a lower floor — and that’s funny because elevators don’t get sick.
https://explainthejoke.com/2021/06/20/made-in-the-shade/,Q: Why didn’t the girl trust the trees near her home? A: They seemed a little shady!,"Explanation: Shade is the darker, cooler area under a tree when the sun is shining on the tree. If you want to get out of the sun, you might stand under a tree in the shade. You might stand in the shady area.
Shady also means something that doesn’t seem quite right, not honest, not trustworthy maybe illegal. If someone tries to sell you an expensive watch for very little money you might say, “No, that seems a little shady.”

https://explainthejoke.com/2015/11/11/incognito/,Q:What do you call a fake noodle? A:An Impasta!,"Explanation:Noodles, such as spaghetti noodles, can be called pasta.
An imposter is a person who pretends to be someone else.
So, a fake noodle is an “impasta” which sounds like a combination of imposter and pasta… and that is what makes this joke funny.
Did you see the movie The Imposter? Here is the trailer:

"
https://explainthejoke.com/2013/12/17/crumbs/,Q: Why did the cookie go to the hospital? A: He was feeling really crumbie!,"Explanation: Crumbs are the little pieces of cookie or bread that fall to the table as you eat; the “b” in the word crumb is silent so it sounds like “crum.”
“To feel crummy” means to feel a little bit sick, not too well but not full-on sick. This joke plays on the words crummy and crumb-ie (crumbie is not a word but puts the “ee” sound at the end of the word “crumb”). That’s just a little joke-ie for today. I hope you are feeling well and not crummy."
https://explainthejoke.com/2013/02/20/hot-dog/,Q: How do you make a hot dog stand? A: Take away its chair!,"Explanation:You know what a hot dog is, right? A “hot dog stand” is a small place that sells hot dogs (see picture). This joke plays on the word stand which is also the opposite of sit. If you take away someone’s chair that person has to stand… just like the hot dog in this joke!
"
https://explainthejoke.com/2013/09/04/scaredy-cow/,Q: What do you call a scared cow? A: A milk shake!,"Explanation: When people get scared, frightened, they sometimes shake because of the fear they feel. A milkshake is a drink that mixes (or shakes) together ice cream and milk (sometimes with fruit or chocolate or …). So, if you shake a cow (which would be really hard to do!) you could get a milk-shake. Or if the cow gets scared it could shake itself and the milk that is inside it thereby making a milkshake. Crazy! It could never happen! That’s why it’s funny!"
https://explainthejoke.com/2022/11/27/no-thorn-no-rose/,Q: Where do roses sleep? A: In a flower bed!,"Explanation: According to many surveys, roses are one of the most popular flowers. Although they have thorns, some people say that they are not that hard to grow.
When you have a garden with flowers (as opposed to a garden with fruits and vegetables), we can call that area a flower bed. If you prepare the flower bed well, the flowers will grow well. I have never heard anyone call a vegetable garden a vegetable bed.
A bed, without flower, is a piece of furniture where people sleep, but you kew that.
This joke is funny because it plays with the word bed and flower bed. Yes, it makes sense that roses would sleep, if they sleep, in a flower bed. (Thank you, Trevor for the joke!)
Here is a motivational speech titled, Make Your Bed:"
https://explainthejoke.com/2018/10/18/hamburger-no-helper/,Q: What do you call a cow with no legs? A: Ground Beef!,"Explanation: Beef is a type of meat that comes from cows, cattle. When this meat is put through a grinder it is called ground beef. Ground beef is the type of meat that is found in hamburgers and other dishes.
This joke is funny because it plays with the word ground. Ground is the land you stand on when you are outside. Ground is also the past tense of the verb grind, to reduce something to small particles.
If a cow has no legs it would be on the ground, therefore, ground beef."
https://explainthejoke.com/2015/08/31/night-drawing/,Q:Why should you take a pencil to bed? A:To draw the curtains!,"Explanation:At night, many people close the curtains (shut the curtains, draw the curtains) to keep the light out. “Draw the curtains” is another way to say, “Close the curtains” or shut the curtains.”
One of the uses of a pencil is to draw, that is, create pictures using a pencil and paper.
This joke is funny because it plays with two meanings of the word draw. Here is a video of how to draw a pencil:

https://explainthejoke.com/2021/01/18/dear-bare/,Q: What do you call a bear with no ears? A: B!,"Explanation: Get it? If you take the word bears and cross off the word ears (b
ears ) you are left with just the letter ‘b.’ Silly, I know. So here is another one…
Q: What do you call a deer with no eyes?
A: No eye-deer!
Explanation: When someone asks you a question, and you do not know the answer, you might say, “I have no idea.” Some English speakers tend to put the ‘r’ sound on the end of the word ‘idea’ so that is sounds like ide-er.
In this joke, a deer with no eyes (a no eye deer) sounds like no ide-er.
By the way, both bear and deer (animals) have words that sound the same, bare and dear. Here is a baby bear meeting a baby deer for the first time (why they were together in a house I do not know!):"
https://explainthejoke.com/2014/12/27/gnomes-and-elves/,Q:What do Santa’s elves do after school? A:Their gnomework!,"Explanation:Gnome rhymes with home. After school most students do homework; elves do “gnomework.” This is funny because elves and gnomes are both magical creatures and because of the rhyme.
If they do their gnomework they will get smarter; hard work = more smarts!
"
https://explainthejoke.com/2022/10/09/oceans-apart/,Q: Why didn’t the girl trust the ocean? A: Because there was something fishy about it!,"Explanation: While there are five named oceans, Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, Pacific and Southern, there is really only one world ocean. I would recommend having much respect for the ocean both because of its power to give life to the earth, and its dangerous power to take life through storms. As you already know the ocean has many fish in it. To trust someone means to have confidence that the person will treat you fairly, be kind, not hurt you.
If something is fishy, that means that there is something suspicious about it. To be fishy is an idiom. (That reminds me of the old saying, “If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.”) Someone offering you $1,000 sounds fishy. Someone offering to sell you something really cheap sounds fishy, it might be stolen or maybe it doesn’t work.
This joke is funny because it brings together the idea of an ocean full of fish and someone who is fishy.
Back in the 1970s John Denver wrote a song in tribute to Jacques Cousteau who studied the oceans. I hope you like it."
https://explainthejoke.com/2014/12/27/gnomes-and-elves/,Q:What do Santa’s elves do after school? A:Their gnomework!,"Explanation:Gnome rhymes with home. After school most students do homework; elves do “gnomework.” This is funny because elves and gnomes are both magical creatures and because of the rhyme.
If they do their gnomework they will get smarter; hard work = more smarts!
"
https://explainthejoke.com/2019/01/25/brilliance/,Q: Why did the teacher wear sunglasses during class? A: Because her students were so bright!,"Explanation: Have you ever seen a teacher wear sunglasses while teaching in a classroom? I haven’t. Most people only wear sunglasses when they are outside in the sun. The light from the sun is so bright that it is good for your eyes to shade them with sunglasses.
Students who are smart can also be called bright. In this case, smart and bright are synonyms.
This joke is funny because it plays with two meanings of the word bright: giving off lots of light and smart.
Here is a song about a bright future and the use of sunglasses (shades):"
https://explainthejoke.com/2013/12/31/sentenced-to/,Q: What happened to the man who shoplifted a calendar on New Year’s Eve? A: He got 12 months!,"Explanation: Shoplifters are people who steal from a store, usually something small (but shoplifters also steal larger items). Shoplifting is against the law so, if you are caught by the police, you might have to go to jail. If you are caught by the police you will have a trial and get sentenced to spend time in jail. In this case, “He got [sentenced to] 12 months” means that he will spend 12 months in jail. This joke is funny because a calendar also has 12 months, and that is what he got when he stole the calendar."
https://explainthejoke.com/2020/12/24/an-english-christmas/,Q: What do you call Santa’s helpers? A: Subordinate Clauses!,"Explanation: Merry Christmas!
In the telling of the story of Santa Claus, the people who help Santa make the toys are typically called elves (one elf, two elves). They are the helpers; they are not the main attraction. They are subordinate.
The word subordinate means lower in rank or position, perhaps less important, like the elves when compared to Santa. This is also true in English grammar when there is a main clause and a subordinate clause. A subordinate clause is part of a sentence, but it does not have enough meaning by itself. If I say “When I get home,” there is an obvious question: What will happen when you get home? That phrase needs more information so we call it subordinate.
This joke is funny (at least to English teachers) because Santa’s helpers are usually known as elves, not as subordinate clauses.
Here is Michael Bublé reading A Visit From St. Nicholas."
https://explainthejoke.com/2021/05/15/cool-as-a-cucumber/,Q: How does a cucumber become a pickle? A: It goes through a jarring experience!,"Explanation: Do you love pickles? I do!
Pickles are little cucumbers that are left in vinegar or brine for a period of time. This is usually done in jars. An interesting note: the process of making pickles is called canning (like, putting in a can) and not jarring.
Jarring is a word used to describe an experience that shocks or disturbs you; it is not a pleasant experience.
This joke is funny because it plays with the word jar-cucumbers are put in jars, so, in a sense they go through a jarring experience.
Watch here to see how glass bottles are made:"
https://explainthejoke.com/2014/01/20/surprised/,Q: How did Ben Franklin feel about discovering electricity? A: He was shocked!,"Explanation: First of all, Ben Franklin did not discover electricity (learn more about the electricity here). What he did was an experiment to prove that lightning was electrical. It is a good thing he wasn’t killed! Anyway, “to be shocked” is to be surprised. “Shocked” is also what you feel when a bit of electricity enters your body. This joke is funny because of the double meaning of the word shocked."
https://explainthejoke.com/2020/05/09/dressed-to-the-nines/,Q: What is the difference between a well-dressed bicyclist and a poorly dressed unicyclist? A: Attire!,"Explanation: Let’s start with some vocabulary:
- Well-dressed means to wear nice clothing (it is the opposite of poorly dressed);
- A bicyclist is a person who rides a bike;
- A unicyclist is a person who rides a unicycle;
- A unicycle is like a bicycle (bike) but it only has one wheel.
If you are well-dressed it means you are wearing nice clothing. Clothing and attire can be used as synonyms, but attire is typically used to mean nice clothing, formal clothing.
Attire also sounds the same as a tire. A bike has two wheels, that is, two tires; a unicycle has only one wheel, one tire. Wheel and tire are synonyms. (Well, people use them as synonyms. The tire is really the rubber part of the wheel, the part that touches the street.)
This joke is funny because it plays with the the word attire: well dressed or a tire, a wheel. So if you are well dressed on a bicycle you have both good attire, and a tire (one tire) more than the unicyclist.
If you want to learn to ride a unicycle, take a look at Finnovation:"
https://explainthejoke.com/2020/12/05/elephant-feathers/,"Q: How do you get down from an elephant? A: You don’t get down from an elephant, you get down from a duck!","Explanation: Yes–another duck joke!
In some places in the world, people ride on elephants, sort of like riding on horses. Because elephants are so big, you might wonder, how do you get up onto the elephant and, once you are on the elephant, how do you get down? Good question! I have never ridden on an elephant.
Down is also the word for the very soft feathers under the harder, outer feathers on a duck or a goose. You might have heard of eider down; you can read more about it here.
This joke is funny because it plays with the word down: the opposite of up and the soft, inner feathers of a duck.
To learn more about elephants, watch this:"
https://explainthejoke.com/2013/01/23/higher-ed/,Q: Why did the child study in the airplane? A: He wanted a higher education!,"Explanation:Higher education: that means studies beyond high school such as going to the university. Higher education does not refer to altitude, like studying while high in the sky; that’s why it’s funny.
"
https://explainthejoke.com/2019/11/04/bogged-down/,Q: What is the difference between a pirate and a cranberry farmer? A: A pirate buries his treasure while a cranberry farmer treasures his berries!,"Explanation: Cranberries are a sour fruit, related to blueberries, that are used to make cranberry sauce and cranberry juice. Because they are so sour they are not usually eaten by themselves.
Pirates are, well, pirates (think Pirates of the Caribbean).
This joke is funny because it plays with the word treasure. When used as a noun it is a thing that is very important to you, like the treasure that pirates bury. When it is a verb, you treat it with respect because of its value to you, you treasure it.
Watch the cranberry harvest here-"
https://explainthejoke.com/2013/12/02/baby-dribbler/,Q: When is a baby good at basketball? A: When it’s dribbling!,"Explanation: “To dribble” the basketball means to bounce the ball as you walk or run down the basketball court. “To dribble” is also to let saliva drop from your mouth. Babies often dribble, that is, they drool, they let saliva or food or milk come out of their mouths.
This joke is funny because it plays on the double meaning of the word dribble; babies cannot dribble a basketball but they dribble all frequently."
https://explainthejoke.com/2021/08/29/a-weight-off-my-shoulder/,Q: Why was the pirate sad when his parrot left? A: It gave him the cold shoulder!,"Explanation: Yes, the last parrot joke for a while.
Have you seen those pictures of a pirate with a parrot sitting on his shoulder? Take a look at this one, if you haven’t. (That link will also explain about the history of parrots and pirates.) I have never had a parrot sit on my shoulder, but I would expect the parrot to feel warm on my shoulder. Then, when the parrot flies away, my shoulder would feel cold.
“To give someone the cold shoulder” means to purposely ignore that person
This joke is funny because it plays with the phrase cold shoulder, in both the literal sense of feeling colder, and in the meaning of the idiom, to ignore someone. Perhaps the parrot was ignoring the pirate, giving him the cold shoulder?
Here is Adele with her song Cold Shoulder–"
https://explainthejoke.com/2021/01/02/a-bigger-better-year/,"Q: If Mr. and Mrs. Bigger had a baby, who would be the biggest of all three of them? A: The baby because the baby is a little Bigger!","Explanation: Happy New Year! A baby joke for the new year seemed appropriate.
If something is a little bigger than something else, that means it is larger. For example, I might say that, typically, a grapefruit is a little bigger than an orange. Sometimes they are a lot bigger.
If a person’s last name is Bigger, well, the whole thing gets more complicated. In this case, the baby is referred to as the little one, or the little Bigger, who is actually smaller because of being a baby.
This joke is funny because the little Bigger (the baby) cannot be a little bigger (larger) than the parents. May your new year be a little better than the past year. (I was going to say bigger, but that wouldn’t make sense.)
Let’s take a look in the opposite direction of bigger: Tiny Houses!"
https://explainthejoke.com/2020/05/09/dressed-to-the-nines/,Q: What is the difference between a well-dressed bicyclist and a poorly dressed unicyclist? A: Attire!,"Explanation: Let’s start with some vocabulary:
- Well-dressed means to wear nice clothing (it is the opposite of poorly dressed);
- A bicyclist is a person who rides a bike;
- A unicyclist is a person who rides a unicycle;
- A unicycle is like a bicycle (bike) but it only has one wheel.
If you are well-dressed it means you are wearing nice clothing. Clothing and attire can be used as synonyms, but attire is typically used to mean nice clothing, formal clothing.
Attire also sounds the same as a tire. A bike has two wheels, that is, two tires; a unicycle has only one wheel, one tire. Wheel and tire are synonyms. (Well, people use them as synonyms. The tire is really the rubber part of the wheel, the part that touches the street.)
This joke is funny because it plays with the the word attire: well dressed or a tire, a wheel. So if you are well dressed on a bicycle you have both good attire, and a tire (one tire) more than the unicyclist.

https://explainthejoke.com/2015/11/30/pop-feelings/,Q: Why did the can crusher quit his job? A: Because it was soda pressing!,"Explanation: A can of pop, a can of Coke, a can of soda… all are pretty much the same thing. Before you recycle the can, though, you should crush it– crush the can, that means to use pressure to change the can from big to little as in the picture. There are machines that can crush a can (called a can crusher) and the person who crushes the can is also called a can crusher). If you press a can of soda (pop) I could say that you are “soda pressing.” It would be an unusual thing to say but I could say it.
The words “soda pressing” sound like “so depressing” and that is what makes this joke funny. If a job is too depressing then someone might quit that job.
Depression is not funny. If you are someone you know is depressed please find help.

https://explainthejoke.com/2013/04/20/baseball-web/,Q: Why would a spider be a good baseball player? A: Because it is good at catching flies!,"Explanation: Spiders catch flies in their webs; flies (fly- singular) are small insects with wings. When spiders build spiderwebs the flies get stuck in them and the spiders eat them. When a baseball player hits a baseball and it goes up in the air to the outfield we say, “the baseball player has hit a fly ball,” that is, the player hit the ball and it flew through the air. The outfielders, the players standing far away from the batter, are waiting to catch the fly balls that have been hit. An outfielder who is good at this is good at catching flies… just like a spider.
Thanks “Tree” for the joke!"
https://explainthejoke.com/2013/09/17/food-thats-fast/,Q: What do racers eat? A: Fast food!,"Explanation: A racer is a person who races, such as a runner or a race car driver. The whole point of a race is to go fast in order to win. “Fast food” is food that you can get at a restaurant like McDonalds: you order the food and they give it to you right away. So if you want to go fast you need to eat food that will give you the energy to go fast, or “fast food.” That’s what makes this joke funny! Of course fast food will not make you fast, fat perhaps, but not fast 🙂 ."
https://explainthejoke.com/2021/08/14/bee-amazing/,Q: What creature is smarter than a talking parrot? A: A spelling bee!,"Explanation: And we’re back!
Perhaps you have seen or heard parrots that talk. Well, they actually mimic (copy) the sounds that they hear. It is quite amazing. In English the typical phrase that a talking parrot says is, “Polly want a cracker.”
A spelling bee is a competition to see who is the best speller, that is, the one who spells the most difficult words. A spelling bee has nothing to do with a bee, the insect that makes honey.
This joke is funny because it plays with the idea of smart animals and then plays again with two meanings of the word bee: an insect and a spelling competition. By the way, there are other types of bees such as a quilting bee which is a gathering of people who make quilts.
Thanks for the joke, Pete!
If you want to see a movie about a spelling bee, I highly recommend this one:"
https://explainthejoke.com/2018/10/18/hamburger-no-helper/,Q: What do you call a cow with no legs? A: Ground Beef!,"Explanation: Beef is a type of meat that comes from cows, cattle. When this meat is put through a grinder it is called ground beef. Ground beef is the type of meat that is found in hamburgers and other dishes.
This joke is funny because it plays with the word ground. Ground is the land you stand on when you are outside. Ground is also the past tense of the verb grind, to reduce something to small particles.
If a cow has no legs it would be on the ground, therefore, ground beef."
https://explainthejoke.com/2022/04/10/live-and-let-live/,Q: Why are cats good at video games? A: Because they have nine lives!,"Explanation: Many video games let you have another chance to keep going if you make a really bad mistake, maybe even getting your character killed. (Other games do not give you another life in the same game, and you have to start over.) I am reminded of the classic video game Pac-Man where you would get three lives. It also reminds me of the pre-video game era when people played pinball, and you had to score the maximum number of points with a limited number of balls.
Cats are known as curious explorers who get themselves into difficult situations. Because of their instincts, including the ability to land on their feet (usually), cats survive (usually). Therefore, in English speaking countries cats are said to have nine lives. (Here is an interesting article about the nine lives of cats.)
This joke is funny because it combines the the lives you get while playing video games with the saying, “cats have nine lives.”
Here is a cat who survived-"
https://explainthejoke.com/2013/02/12/peanut-butter-and-traffic-jam/,Q: Why did the girl spread peanut butter on the road? A: To go with the traffic jam!,Explanation: Peanut butter and jelly is a common type of sandwich in the United States. Jam and jelly are synonyms (they are not identical but very much the same). A traffic jam is when there are so many cars in one place that the cars are stopped (or moving very slowly). This joke plays with the word jam- the kind that goes with peanut butter and the kind that stops traffic. Ha ha ha!
https://explainthejoke.com/2019/01/07/on-your-marks/,Q: How do you keep an elephant from charging? A: Take away its credit cards!,"Explanation: When an elephant runs towards you or something else, we say the elephant is charging, much like a bull might charge (run) at the cape of a matador. To charge is also to pay for something by credit card. The beginning of the joke makes us think of how to stop an elephant from running at something- very difficult to do!
This joke is funny because it plays with the two of the meanings of the word charge: a way of moving forward and using a credit card.
The word charge has many other meanings, such as charging your phone or to accuse someone of doing something wrong.
Here is an elephant charging and someone stopping it:"
https://explainthejoke.com/2013/03/19/rule-me-this/,Q: Why was the king only a foot tall? A: Because he was a ruler!,"Explanation: A ruler is one who rules, that is, one who is in charge like a king or a president. A ruler is also a stick used for measuring items. In this case a ruler is 12 inches long, a foot long. This joke plays on the double meaning of the work ruler. This joke really measures up!"
https://explainthejoke.com/2021/05/15/cool-as-a-cucumber/,Q: How does a cucumber become a pickle? A: It goes through a jarring experience!,"Explanation: Do you love pickles? I do!
Pickles are little cucumbers that are left in vinegar or brine for a period of time. This is usually done in jars. An interesting note: the process of making pickles is called canning (like, putting in a can) and not jarring.
Jarring is a word used to describe an experience that shocks or disturbs you; it is not a pleasant experience.
This joke is funny because it plays with the word jar-cucumbers are put in jars, so, in a sense they go through a jarring experience.
Watch here to see how glass bottles are made:"
https://explainthejoke.com/2020/08/01/whether-balloon/,Q: What music frightens balloons? A: Pop music!,"Explanation: When balloons explode, we say they pop. If you stick a pin in a balloon, it pops. If balloons had feelings, I am pretty sure that they would be scared of things that make the pop.
‘Pop’ is also a type of music, originally from the term ‘popular music.’ Pop music now refers to music that is commercial (sells a lot), usually upbeat, and uses a verse/chorus format. Yea, that’s probably too much information. (By the way, pop can also mean father, and soda.)
This joke is funny because it plays with the word pop–both a type of music and an action that end the life of a balloon. There is a lot of famous pop music. Here is one of the pop music examples from the list (#26) in the previous links:"
https://explainthejoke.com/2020/10/17/in-the-slow-lane/,Q: What do you get when you combine a porcupine and a turtle? A: A slowpoke!,"Explanation: A porcupine is an animal that has needles which are called quills. The quills are sharp on the end and will hurt if they touch you, if they poke you (like when you get a shot in the arm).
Turtles are animals that usually move slowly.
This joke is funny because it combines the idea of a slow turtle and a porcupine with quills that can poke you into a slowpoke: a slowpoke is someone who does something too slowly.
Here is another animal that moves slowly: the sloth."
https://explainthejoke.com/2014/05/16/1-00-for-what/,Q: How much did the butcher charge for his venison? A: A buck!,"Explanation: There is so much going on in this joke! To begin with, a butcher is a person who prepares/ cuts meat so that it is ready to be cooked. Venison is meat that comes from a deer; a female deer is called a doe and a male deer is called a buck. A buck is also another name for one U.S. dollar ($1.00). This joke is funny because it plays on the double meaning of the work “buck.”"
https://explainthejoke.com/2021/12/04/a-little-off-the-sides/,Q: Why did the Christmas tree go to the barber? A: Because it needed to be trimmed!,"Explanation: Now that it is December, ’tis the season when many people prepare to celebrate Christmas. For those who celebrate, buying and decorating a Christmas tree is often very important. Decorating the tree is also called trimming the tree.
When you go to the barber to get your hair cut, you might say to the barber, “Just a trim.” This means that you want the barber to only cut a little bit of your hair.
This joke is funny because of the double meanings of the word trim: a little bit of a haircut and decorating a Christmas tree.
To hear more about trimming the tree, listen to this song from The Grinch Who Stole Christmas:

https://explainthejoke.com/2014/01/09/dancing-alone/,Q: Why didn’t the skeleton go to the ball? A: He had no body to dance with!,"Explanation: “Ball” is a synonym for “dance.” So, why didn’t the skeleton go to the dance? Well, because a skeleton is all bones and nothing else, a skeleton does not have a body. That is, he has no body. When you put those two words together you get “nobody.” This joke is funny because it plays with the words “no body” and “nobody.” If he had nobody to go to the dance with he would go alone. In this case he had “no body.”"
