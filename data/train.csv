https://explainthejoke.com/2014/06/02/tied-up-in-string/,Q: Why didnâ€™t the string ever win a race? A: It always tied!,"The joke plays on the double meaning of the word 'tied.' In one sense, 'tied' means to finish a race at the same time as another competitor, resulting in a draw. In another sense, 'tied' refers to the action of tying a knot. Since the subject of the joke is a 'string,' the humor arises from imagining the string as always tying itself into knots, which humorously explains why it could never win a race."
https://explainthejoke.com/2021/04/10/holy-toledo/,Q: Why did the golfer wear two pairs of pants? A: In case he got a hole in one!,"This joke plays on the double meaning of the phrase 'hole in one'. In golf, 'a hole in one' refers to a player hitting the ball directly from the tee into the hole with one stroke, which is a very good outcome. However, in the context of wearing pants, 'a hole in one' humorously suggests a literal hole in one of the pairs of pants. Thus, the golfer wearing two pairs of pants is a silly precaution to ensure he still has one intact pair if one gets a hole."
https://explainthejoke.com/2015/08/28/jail-call/,Q:What do prisoners use to call each other? A:Cell phones!,"The joke plays on the double meaning of the word 'cell.' In one sense, a 'cell' is a small room where prisoners are kept, and in another sense, it refers to 'cellular phones,' commonly known as cell phones. The humor arises from the pun created by using 'cell phones' to imply that prisoners would use phones related to their incarceration cells to communicate."
https://explainthejoke.com/2019/11/16/stealth/,Q: What kind of shoes does a ninja wear? A: Sneakers!,"The joke plays on the word 'sneakers' which is a type of shoe known for being comfortable and quiet, ideal for casual wear. However, in the context of the joke, 'sneakers' also refers to the ability to sneak around silently, which is a stereotypical attribute of a ninja. Thus, the humor arises from the double meaning of 'sneakers' as both a type of shoe and a description of a ninja's stealthy behavior."
https://explainthejoke.com/2013/01/26/cinderellas-ball/,Q: Why did Cinderella get kicked off the soccer team? A: Because she ran away from the ball!,"The joke plays on the double meaning of the word 'ball'. In the context of the story of Cinderella, 'ball' refers to the formal dance she attends, from which she famously runs away at midnight. In the context of soccer, 'ball' refers to the soccer ball, which players should not run away from if they want to play effectively. The humor arises from the absurdity of applying the fairy tale behavior to the soccer field, creating a funny and unexpected reason for Cinderella to be kicked off the team."
https://explainthejoke.com/2015/11/30/pop-feelings/,Q: Why did the can crusher quit his job? A: Because it was soda pressing!,"The joke plays on the double meaning of 'soda pressing.' It sounds like 'so depressing,' referring to how someone might feel in a mundane or repetitive job. In the context of the joke, the can crusher, which literally crushes cans (including soda cans), is said to quit because the job is 'soda pressing,' implying both that the job involves pressing soda cans and that it is emotionally depressing."
https://explainthejoke.com/2014/05/16/1-00-for-what/,Q: How much did the butcher charge for his venison? A: A buck!,"The joke plays on the double meaning of the word 'buck.' In one sense, 'buck' is a slang term for a dollar, suggesting that the venison was very cheap. In another sense, 'buck' refers to a male deer, which is what venison comes from. The humor arises from the unexpected double entendre linking the cost of the venison to the animal itself."
https://explainthejoke.com/2022/12/11/spare-change/,Q: When does it rain money? A: When there is change in the weather!,"The joke plays on the double meaning of the word 'change'. In one sense, 'change' refers to alterations in the weather conditions, but it also refers to coins, which are a form of money. The humor arises from the unexpected link between the concept of weather changing and the idea of coins falling like raindrops, which is a whimsical and absurd visual."
https://explainthejoke.com/2022/03/20/do-you-see-what-i-see/,Q: Why did the computer get new glasses? A: To improve his web sight!,"The joke plays on the double meaning of the word 'sight.' In one sense, sight refers to the ability to see, which logically connects to wearing glasses. In another sense, 'site' is a homophone of 'sight' and refers to a location on the internet, such as a website. Therefore, the joke humorously suggests that the computer, a device used for accessing the internet, got glasses to improve its 'web sight,' punning on improving its ability to 'see' websites better."
https://explainthejoke.com/2020/04/18/paper-cut/,Q: What did the Daddy Scissors say to his children when they acted up? A: Cut it out!,"The joke plays on the dual meaning of the phrase 'Cut it out!' In one sense, it's a common expression used to tell someone to stop misbehaving or stop doing something annoying. In the context of the joke, 'Daddy Scissors' using the phrase 'Cut it out!' is humorous because scissors are literally used to cut things. Thus, the phrase works both as a reprimand and a literal action that scissors can perform."
