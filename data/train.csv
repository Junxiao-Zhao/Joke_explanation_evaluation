https://explainthejoke.com/2020/01/24/my-treat/,Q: What did one plate say to the other? A: Dinner is on me!,"Explanation: When a meal such as breakfast, lunch, or dinner is served, it is typically put on a plate. If you go to a restaurant, the server may bring your food on a tray; the plates are then taken from the tray and set on your table. Your food is on the plate. So, if a plate full of food is talking, dinner (or lunch or breakfast) is really on the plate.
‚ÄúDinner is on me‚Äù is also an idiom that means, ‚ÄúI will pay for your food.‚Äù When you go to a restaurant and someone says to you, ‚ÄúDinner is on me,‚Äù it means that the speaker will buy your meal. (Be sure to say, ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù if someone buys your dinner!)
This joke is funny because it plays with the idiom, ‚Äúdinner is on me.‚Äù Dinner is actually on the plate‚Ä¶ and, in this joke, the plate will pay for dinner. (By the way, the title ‚ÄúMy treat‚Äù is another idiom that means that the speaker will pay for the meal.)

https://explainthejoke.com/2013/09/17/food-thats-fast/,Q: What do racers eat? A: Fast food!,"Explanation: A racer is a person who races, such as a runner or a race car driver. The whole point of a race is to go fast in order to win. ‚ÄúFast food‚Äù is food that you can get at a restaurant like McDonalds: you order the food and they give it to you right away. So if you want to go fast you need to eat food that will give you the energy to go fast, or ‚Äúfast food.‚Äù That‚Äôs what makes this joke funny! Of course fast food will not make you fast, fat perhaps, but not fast üôÇ ."
https://explainthejoke.com/2014/12/27/gnomes-and-elves/,Q:What do Santa‚Äôs elves do after school? A:Their gnomework!,"Explanation:Gnome rhymes with home. After school most students do homework; elves do ‚Äúgnomework.‚Äù This is funny because elves and gnomes are both magical creatures and because of the rhyme.
If they do their gnomework they will get smarter; hard work = more smarts!

https://explainthejoke.com/2018/10/18/hamburger-no-helper/,Q: What do you call a cow with no legs? A: Ground Beef!,"Explanation: Beef is a type of meat that comes from cows, cattle. When this meat is put through a grinder it is called ground beef. Ground beef is the type of meat that is found in hamburgers and other dishes.
This joke is funny because it plays with the word ground. Ground is the land you stand on when you are outside. Ground is also the past tense of the verb grind, to reduce something to small particles.
If a cow has no legs it would be on the ground, therefore, ground beef."
https://explainthejoke.com/2015/08/31/night-drawing/,Q:Why should you take a pencil to bed? A:To draw the curtains!,"Explanation:At night, many people close the curtains (shut the curtains, draw the curtains) to keep the light out. ‚ÄúDraw the curtains‚Äù is another way to say, ‚ÄúClose the curtains‚Äù or shut the curtains.‚Äù
One of the uses of a pencil is to draw, that is, create pictures using a pencil and paper.
This joke is funny because it plays with two meanings of the word draw. Here is a video of how to draw a pencil:

https://explainthejoke.com/2021/06/20/made-in-the-shade/,Q: Why didn‚Äôt the girl trust the trees near her home? A: They seemed a little shady!,"Explanation: Shade is the darker, cooler area under a tree when the sun is shining on the tree. If you want to get out of the sun, you might stand under a tree in the shade. You might stand in the shady area.
Shady also means something that doesn‚Äôt seem quite right, not honest, not trustworthy maybe illegal. If someone tries to sell you an expensive watch for very little money you might say, ‚ÄúNo, that seems a little shady.‚Äù
This joke is funny because it plays with the word shady, like under a tree in the sun or a dishonest situation or person.
By the way, Happy Father‚Äôs Day to all the fathers out there, and to all people who are like a father to someone.
Here is a shady character from one of my favorite books, Ray Bradbury‚Äôs Something Wicked This Way Comes ( it‚Äôs a bit scary):"
https://explainthejoke.com/2022/11/27/no-thorn-no-rose/,Q: Where do roses sleep? A: In a flower bed!,"Explanation: According to many surveys, roses are one of the most popular flowers. Although they have thorns, some people say that they are not that hard to grow.
When you have a garden with flowers (as opposed to a garden with fruits and vegetables), we can call that area a flower bed. If you prepare the flower bed well, the flowers will grow well. I have never heard anyone call a vegetable garden a vegetable bed.
A bed, without flower, is a piece of furniture where people sleep, but you kew that.
This joke is funny because it plays with the word bed and flower bed. Yes, it makes sense that roses would sleep, if they sleep, in a flower bed. (Thank you, Trevor for the joke!)
Here is a motivational speech titled, Make Your Bed:"
https://explainthejoke.com/2019/01/07/on-your-marks/,Q: How do you keep an elephant from charging? A: Take away its credit cards!,"Explanation: When an elephant runs towards you or something else, we say the elephant is charging, much like a bull might charge (run) at the cape of a matador. To charge is also to pay for something by credit card. The beginning of the joke makes us think of how to stop an elephant from running at something- very difficult to do!
This joke is funny because it plays with the two of the meanings of the word charge: a way of moving forward and using a credit card.
The word charge has many other meanings, such as charging your phone or to accuse someone of doing something wrong.
Here is an elephant charging and someone stopping it:"
https://explainthejoke.com/2013/12/09/going-up-or-down/,Q: What did one elevator say to the other elevator? A: I think I‚Äôm coming down with something!,Explanation: There is a double meaning in this joke: ‚ÄúTo come down with something‚Äù is to get sick; elevators come down with something- people. When the first elevator says it is coming down with something the listener hears the double meaning of getting sick and going to a lower floor ‚Äî and that‚Äôs funny because elevators don‚Äôt get sick.
https://explainthejoke.com/2014/05/19/braniac/,Q:Why is spaghetti the smartest food? A:It always uses its noodle!,"Explanation:Yum! Spaghetti! To ‚Äúuse your noodle‚Äù is to use your brain, that is, to think. Spaghetti is a type of noodle.
This joke plays with the word noodle, both your brain and the pasta. Now I‚Äôm hungry and off to the kitchen I go!
